    "I went through quite a few statistics courses at univeristy years ago, and come to enjoy the discipline very much. However, a great period of disuse of the knowledge and having had only the experience of working things out on paper (or sometimes a spreadsheet) leads to to going through this textbook with Jupyter notebooks. I will mostly just be going through exercises and building graphs, but with a few other notes here and there."
